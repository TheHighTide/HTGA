# HTGA
This is HighTide's official app!

## About
**HTGA** is HighTide's official app. HTGA stands for *HighTide General App*. This app can be used to keep track of what HighTide is doing. It will be updated very regularly! The HTGA is an easy to use way for HighTide's followers to catch up with his projects. Whenever HighTide starts a new project, the app will be updated to have that project in a list of current projects. If you want to stay up to date without using this app, you can follow me here on GitHub so you never miss a new project. With this app you can do more than just look at the things I do... You can also generate random things, make art, create files easily, and much much more. I really hope you enjoy this awesome level!

## Wiki
This app has a new wiki! The wiki is where you can go to to find anything you need to know about anything in this app. This wiki has every command and it's usage in order to make the use of this app very easy!

## Major Update
Currently there is a goal of mine to learn c++ and or c. To start that goal easier, I will be writing **HTGA** in *c++* so that I can learn while making a helpful app. Due to this sudden switch, there will be another delay added to the count because of the time it is taking to finish the build script. I can't currently decide whether to do it in makefile or cmake. Please bare with me and check out the current c++ build in the project releases.

The most recent major update that this program recieved was responsible for the **removal of the linux and mac** support for the program. This was because when I ported the program to _Visual Studio 2022_ from _Visual Studio Code_, it caused the possibility of a port to be impossible. Although, the program is still written in **c++** making it possible for a third-party to port the program to other os's for themselves. Right now though, my main concern is keeping the program up and running for Windows making it run smooth and have up to date features that the community enjoys. 

## Development
Right now the program is being developed at a steady pace. Judging by the current pace, version 1.0 will release in about 1-2 months. Currently development is easier because of GitHub's **codespace** feature. What the codespace feature does is it creates a virtual machine in the browser or GitHub app that allows me to edit source code directly on GitHub. That feature alone helps me develop the app/program much much faster!

## The Team
Sadly, I am working on this project alone as I need to make this perfect to match my needs and your needs. The HighTideTeam is not all working on this project at the same time to make it easier to make!

## Issue Tracking
At the moment, I am working on getting the **issue tracker** that is built-in to GitHub working with this repository. I think with this feature, me and anyone else whom may help me in future development will have a great view on all the issues that arrise in this repository or entire program for that matter. At the moment, I am relying on the **projects tab** in this repository making this a huge step in the right direction for me and everyone else. If you are wondering, **the projects tab** is hidden to the public making it invisible to anyone who isn't a part of the projects development team.

# App Help
## Commands:
If you don't already know, this application is a command-line based app which means you have to enter all of the commands by hand as apose to the GUI based apps windows/some linux has. 
Some of the commands are: 
1. `help`
2. `version`
3. `exit xor quit`

You can check out a more indepth command list [here in the wiki](https://github.com/TheHighTide/HTGA/wiki/Commands).

Those are all the possible commands right now as the app isn't fully developed!
