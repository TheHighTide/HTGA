# HTGA
This is HighTide's official app!

## About
**HTGA** is HighTide's official app. HTGA stands for *HighTide General App*. This app can be used to keep track of what HighTide is doing. It will be updated very regularly! The HTGA is an easy to use way for HighTide's followers to catch up with his projects. Whenever HighTide starts a new project, the app will be updated to have that project in a list of current projects. If you want to stay up to date without using this app, you can follow me here on GitHub so you never miss a new project. With this app you can do more than just look at the things I do... You can also generate random things, make art, create files easily, and much much more. I really hope you enjoy this awesome level!

## Wiki
This app has a new wiki! The wiki is where you can go to to find anything you need to know about anything in this app. This wiki has every command and it's usage in order to make the use of this app very easy!



## Development
Right now the program is being developed at a steady pace. Judging by the current pace, version 1.0 will release in about 1-2 months. Currently development is easier because of GitHub's **codespace** feature. What the codespace feature does is it creates a virtual machine in the browser or GitHub app that allows me to edit source code directly on GitHub. That feature alone helps me develop the app/program much much faster!

## The Team
Sadly, I am working on this project alone as I need to make this perfect to match my needs and your needs. The HighTideTeam is not all working on this project at the same time to make it easier to make!
